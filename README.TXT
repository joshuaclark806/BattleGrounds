HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
AUTHORS: Josh Clark
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Run BattleGround class to run once, or Simulate to run 10,000 times
COMPLETITION: I kinda didn't do quite what you set out, but you can run the game and it
tells you if Team A or B won, and you can run it 10,000 times to see how many times each team wins
